Task 1
	The way that I am designing for the format is using HDLC frame format which requires two byte
  sequence to mentioning the beginning sequence and the ending sequence. The header is 2 bytes
  which contains HDLC address and HDLC control field. And then 2 bytes for the CRC. So in total,
  the size for encapsulate size is 6.
  However, the ending sequence also represent the beginning sequence of the next frame. So the 
  encapsulate size is 5, but I will set the size to be 6. Since I can find the ending sequence
  of the previous frame, and set it to be the beginning of the current frame. So in total, 
  still 6 bytes.
  So the frame is actually with the format of 
  beginSeq address_field control_field payload crc endSeq
